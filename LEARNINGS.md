## Ready for Project 2?

**Self-assessment checklist:**
- [ ] Can I explain how LLM context windows work?
- [ ] Do I understand the cost implications of different approaches?
- [ ] Can I explain prompt caching to someone else?
- [ ] Am I comfortable with basic SQL operations?
- [ ] Do I know how to debug API errors?
- [ ] Can I structure a Python project with multiple modules?

**Overall confidence level:** [1-10]
